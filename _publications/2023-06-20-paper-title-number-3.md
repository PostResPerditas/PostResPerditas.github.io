Abstract
======

With the rapid development of automated and intelligent processing methods in the field of manufacturing, polishing processing methods based on industrial robots have been more and more widely used because of their advantages of high processing efficiency, large operating space, high processing quality and consistency. Industrial robot is difficult to be directly applied to the polishing of various workpieces, so it is necessary to design an end effector that can achieve constant force control to ensure the stability of the output force in the robot polishing process.
Based on thetheory of small tool polishing, this paper designs a wheel polishing tool that can realize the dual-rotation motion, and completes the modeling and experimental verification of the removal function. In addition, based on the parallel connection of negative stiffness flexible beam and positive stiffness spring, a constant force control mechanism that can realize quasi-zero stiffness output is designed. Finally, the force control effect of the end effector is verified by experimental method, and the influence law of different process parameters on the removal function and the way to keep the removal function stable are studied.
