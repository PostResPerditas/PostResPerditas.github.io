I am currently a third-year graduate student from the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, working on the dexterous grasping and robotic manipulation. I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation in 2023 from Dalian University of Technology.

Research Interests and Projects
======
My current research interests include dexterous grasping planning, geometry-based problem modeling and reinforce learning methods. The main focus of my current research is to achieve stable and intelligent robotic grasping and manipulation of diverse objects. My research is advised by Prof. Sijie Yan from School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My future research plan and interest are to combine state-of-the-art robotic perception and control technologies with actual needs in unstructed scenarios to solve problems like manipulation of deformable objects, adaptive grasping, and dynamic control.
